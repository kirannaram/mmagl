    <div class="content-block__text">EyeSight is a driving support system that uses a range of functions to assist the driver in making decisions in order to provide for more safe and comfortable driving and to reduce driver fatigue. It is designed to help assist drivers, not replace them.</div>

        <div class="content-block__title">
            Pre-Collision Braking System
        </div>
        <div class="content-block__text">
            <p>This function can recognize an impending collision with an obstacle, such as a motorcycle or pedestrian, or with a vehicle traveling in the same lane ahead of the EyeSight vehicle. It informs the driver with audible and visual alerts. If the driver takes no corrective action, the system will automatically apply the brakes to help avoid the collision or minimize  impact when a collision is inevitable.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block__title">
            Pre-Collision Brake Assist
        </div>
        <div class="content-block__text">
            <p>If EyeSight recognizes an impending collision with an obstacle or a vehicle traveling in the same lane ahead of the EyeSight vehicle, and the driver does not apply enough brake pedal force, Pre-Collision Brake Assist automatically applies up to full braking pressure in order to try to reduce stopping distance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block__title">
            Pre-Collision Throttle Management
        </div>
        <div class="content-block__text">
        	<p>This function is designed to help prevent drivers from unintentionally accelerating into a stopped vehicle or other obstacle in front of the EyeSight vehicle. It simultaneously warns the driver and reduces engine power until the driver applies the brakes to help avoid an impact.</p>
        	<p>Pre-Collision Throttle Management is helpful when:</p>
            <ul class="content-block__unordered-list">
                <li>The driver inadvertently selects Drive instead of Reverse and starts to accelerate toward a parked car, wall or parking structure.</li>
                <li>Starting to merge onto another road when the vehicle ahead accelerates, but suddenly stops.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block__title">
        	Lane Departure Warning
        </div>
        <div class="content-block__text">
        	<p>Lane Departure Warning works at speeds of approximately 30 mph or greater to alert the driver when the vehicle unintentionally moves out of its travel lane and the turn signal is not
        	used. It takes no corrective vehicle action other than issuing visual and audible warnings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block__title">
        	Lane Sway Warning
        </div>
        <div class="content-block__text">
        	<p>Lane Sway Warning works at speeds of approximately 38 mph or greater. It detects repetitive or unusual side-to-side vehicle movement within the driver’s lane of travel that is usually
        	indicative of a drowsy driver.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block__title">
            Lane Keep Assist with Lane Departure Prevention
        </div>
        <div class="content-block__text">
            <p>By detecting lane markings in the lane of travel, the system assists the steering operation to help keep the vehicle within its lane. If the vehicle is about to deviate from a driving lane and starts crossing the road lines, steering assistance control is triggered in the opposite direction, helping to avoid lane deviation. A departure warning sound and display in the instrument cluster alert the driver. These features are designed to function at speeds of approximately 40 mph or greater. Therefore, it is best used on freeways, 
            expressways or interstate highways..</p>
            <em>Note: This is a driver selectable feature and must be turned on to be functional.</em>

        <div class="content-block__title">
            Adaptive Cruise Control and Conventional Cruise Control
        </div>
        <div class="content-block__text">
            <p>This function combines the benefits of Cruise Control with active monitoring of the road ahead by EyeSight. The system works at speeds above approximately 20 mph and issues warnings and activates automatic braking when needed.</p>
            <p>When selected by the driver, Adaptive Cruise Control can regulate the driver set speed in order to keep the driver-selected gap between the EyeSight vehicle and the vehicle ahead traveling in the same lane. It does not replace Conventional Cruise Control, which can still be used, when desired, without the adaptive function.</p>
            <p>Conventional Cruise Control maintains a constant driver set speed. It does not mirror the speed of a vehicle traveling in the same lane ahead of the EyeSight vehicle. See the Owner’s
            Manual for additional information.</p>

        <div class="content-block__text">
            <p>Lead Vehicle Start Alert notifies the driver when the vehicle in front has started moving but the EyeSight driver’s vehicle has not. This occurs when the lead vehicle has moved
            forward a minimum of 10 feet.</p>
