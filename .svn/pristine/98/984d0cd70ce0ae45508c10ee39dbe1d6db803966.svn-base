    <!-- EyeSight Limitations Content -->
    
    <ul class="content-block__unordered-list">
        <li>The EyeSight system needs time to recognize an object or potential obstacle. When the vehicle speed differential with an obstacle in front is greater than approximately 30 mph, it may not be possible to avoid an impending collision.</li>
        <li>Sun glare, inclement weather such as heavy rain, blinding snow or fog, or a dirty windshield will hinder EyeSight operation. A cracked windshield, oil film on the glass or reflections may impede EyeSight performance. In these conditions, EyeSight may not operate properly or EyeSight may temporarily stop operating. If you cannot see, EyeSight cannot see.
        </li>
        <li>EyeSight may not recognize low-contrast objects, those with regularly spaced patterns, no pattern, horizontal lines, backlit objects, very small objects (less than 3 feet tall) or
        non-standard shaped vehicles, such as cement mixers or car-carrier trucks.</li>
        <li>Cargo loaded on the vehicle roof must be positioned so as to not interfere with or obstruct the cameraâ€™s view.</li>
        <li>Non-approved aftermarket vehicle accessories, such as hood protectors, and waterrepellent glass coatings should not be used with EyeSight-equipped vehicles. EyeSight
        may not operate properly or EyeSight may temporarily stop operating.</li>
    </ul>
