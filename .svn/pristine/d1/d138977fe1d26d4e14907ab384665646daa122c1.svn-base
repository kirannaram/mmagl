            Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA)&nbsp; (if equipped)
        </div>
        <div class="content-block__text">
            <p>Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA) notifies the driver of a collision danger if a vehicle is detected approaching from either direction, perpendicular to the reversing vehicle. The system uses radar detection sensors located in the left rear and right rear of the vehicle. The system uses an audible and visual warning to alert the driver.</p>

            Lane Change Assist (LCA)&nbsp; (if equipped)
        </div>
        <div class="content-block__text">
            <p>Lane Change Assist (LCA) notifies the driver of an approaching vehicle in an adjacent lane or lanes. The system uses radar detection sensors located in the left rear and right rear of the vehicle. The sensors illuminate a vehicle icon in the exterior mirror on the side in which the oncoming vehicle is detected. When the driver uses the turn signal indicator to switch lanes, and a vehicle is in their path, the radar detection sensor flashes the vehicle icon only in the exterior mirror on the side the oncoming vehicle is detected.</p>

        <div class="content-block__title">
            Blind Spot Detection (BSD)&nbsp; (if equipped)
        </div>
        <div class="content-block__text">
        	<p>Blind Spot Detection (BSD) assists the driver by detecting vehicles located on either side of the vehicle that are hidden from the driver’s view in the exterior mirror. The system uses radar detection sensors located in the left rear and right rear of the vehicle. The sensors illuminate a vehicle icon only in the exterior mirror on the side the oncoming vehicle is detected. When the driver uses the turn signal indicator to switch lanes, and a vehicle is in their path, the radar detection sensor flashes the vehicle icon only in the exterior mirror on the side the oncoming vehicle is detected.</p>

        	Front View Monitor&nbsp; (if equipped)
        </div>
        <div class="content-block__text">
        	<p>The front view monitor displays an image of the front and front side views of the vehicle on the multi-function display. The system has a camera located in the grille. This system
            helps eliminate blind spots in front of the vehicle and allows the driver to check the forward direction of travel.</p>

        <div class="content-block__title">
        	Reverse Automatic Braking (RAB) System&nbsp; (if equipped)
        </div>
        <div class="content-block__text">
        	<p>The Reverse Automatic Braking (RAB) system is designed to assist the driver by detecting objects, to help avoid a possible collision, when the vehicle is moving in a low speed reverse direction. The system will provide automatic vehicle braking, if a obstacle is detected within its range.</p>
            <p>This system is not a substitute for safe and attentive driving. System effectiveness depends on many factors, such as vehicle maintenance, weather, and road conditions. Excessive  build-up of dirt, snow or ice will affect the operation of the RAB system. Always exercise caution and use vehicle mirrors and the Rear-Vision Camera when backing up. See the Owner’s Manual for complete details on system operation and limitations.</p>

        <div class="content-block__title">
            High Beam Assist (HBA)&nbsp; (if equipped)
        </div>
        <div class="content-block__text">
            <p>High Beam Assist automatically switches the headlights between the high and low beams when the headlight switch is in the high beam position. The system works in conjunction with the EyeSight system. The EyeSight system detects a vehicle ahead, or oncoming vehicles, and switches the headlights automatically from high beam to low beam. See the Owner’s
            Manual for complete details on system operation and limitations.</p>

            Steering Responsive Headlights (SRH)&nbsp; (if equipped)
        </div>
        <div class="content-block__text">
            <p>The Steering Responsive Headlights (SRH) system aims the headlight beams in the direction of vehicle travel on curved roads to help improve visibility at night. See the Owner’s Manual for complete details on system operation and limitations.</p>
